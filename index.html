  <p>Disputes about which operating system is the best are going on for ages. Ones may be in team PC that’s run by Windows; others may be in team Apple that is run by Mac operating system and some may prefer Linux over the rest.</p>

  <h3>Windows</h3>
  <p> With almost 90% of the operating system market share, you can't miss Windows. It's in commercial buildings, industrial facilities, as well as home computers.
Windows, having been introduced in 1985, is a very mature and complete piece of software. Yet, it has it's flaws...  </p>

<h3>Apple's Macintosh OS</h3>
<p> is even older than Windows. It is the first ever successful graphical-based operating system, being released one year before it's Microsoft counterpart.
   Apple Macs get almost no viruses. This is mostly due to Window's superior market share.
   Macs only run on Apple computers, and are thus less prone to hardware and software crashing.</p>
   
  <h3>Linux</h3>
<p>Linux is GNU's answer to Mac and Windows. Yes, this means that Linux is FREE! By free, you can download, modify and redistribute it without spending a dime! . Linux is a younger player in the OS world, having been written in 1991, and is optimized for modern use (well, more than Windows and Mac)</p>

        <td>there is an opinion that Macs are easier to use and work with – they are much more consumer oriented than Windows</td>
		<td>GNU/Linux operating systems have a steeper learning curve for the average user. They frequently require a deeper understanding of the underlying system to perform day-to-day functions. </td>
